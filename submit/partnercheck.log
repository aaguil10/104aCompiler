partnercheck: ./PARTNER: no such user: "This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Alejandro Aguilar (aaguil10@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Mitchell Allen (mijallen@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individualâ€™s effort for an assignment should
bespent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must
be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work together,
learning from each other, not to divide the work into two
pieces with each partner working on a different piece. 
Alejandro Aguilar spent __5__ hours working alone.
Mitchell Allen spent __5__ hours working alone.
We spent __20__hours working together.
Alejandro Aguilar spent __10__ hours driving.
Mitchell Allen spent __10__ hours driving.
Please grade the work submitted by aaguil10@ucsc.edu
and not the work submitted by mijallen@ucsc.edu."
